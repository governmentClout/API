# API

This is government clout API server/code.


### Run Locally

To get the API server running on your local follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo
2. `cd` into the directory
3. go into lib/config.js and enter your database details (just your login details, do not change database name)
4. Install mysql, uuid, and randomstring
5. run `node index.js`

The codebase is wired to create database, and setup all tables itself.


You are now ready to test each endpoint based on the documentation here: developers.staybusy.ng
